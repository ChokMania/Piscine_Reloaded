## Introduction
The Piscine Reloaded is a best-of of the exercises you did during the Piscine C to remind you all the basics of the C programming language. All the exercises has to be done entierly to unlock the next project. If you have already done some of these exercises during the Piscine C, we highly recommend not be tempted to retrieve your old code. The learning of programming involves practice and making an existing code has no interest.
